    <p>Very fast and light, but no threads or forks</p>
    <p>Only implement what's needed from the HTTP standard</p>
    <p>Honestly still not sure what I want to do with this, maybe an actual website ?</p>
    <p>Ways to build html with styles on runtime AND / OR comptime</p>
    <p>Potentially rewrite things in different languages ?</p>
